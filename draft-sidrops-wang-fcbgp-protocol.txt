                     FC-BGP Protocol Specification
                draft-sidrops-wang-fcbgp-protocol-latest

Abstract

   This document describes Forwarding Commitment BGP (FC-BGP), an
   extension to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that provides security
   for the path of Autonomous Systems (ASes) through which a BGP UPDATE
   message passes.  Forwarding Commitment（FC）is a cryptographically
   signed code to certify an AS's routing intent on its directly
   connected hops.  Based on FC, the goal of FC-BGP is to build a secure
   inter-domain system that can simultaneously authenticate the AS_PATH
   attribute in BGP-UPDATE and validate network forwarding on the data
   plane.
