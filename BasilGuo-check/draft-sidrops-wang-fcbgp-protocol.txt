                     FC-BGP Protocol Specification
                draft-sidrops-wang-fcbgp-protocol-latest

Abstract

   This document describes Forwarding Commitment BGP (FC-BGP), an
   extension to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that provides security
   for the path of Autonomous Systems (ASes) through which a BGP UPDATE
   message passes.  Forwarding Commitment（FC）is a cryptographically
   signed code to certify an AS's routing intent on its directly
   connected hops.  Based on FC, FC-BGP aims to build a secure inter-
   domain system that can simultaneously authenticate the AS_PATH
   attribute in BGP UPDATE and validate network forwarding on the data
   plane.

1.  Introduction

   The FC-BGP control plane mechanism described in this document is used
   to verify the authenticity of BGP advertised routes.  Compared to
   BGPsec, the FC-BGP control plane mechanism is characterized by its
   support for partial deployment and its security guarantees in partial
   deployment scenarios.

   FC-BGP extends the BGP UPDATE message with a new optional,
   transitive, and extended path attribute called FC (Forwarding
   Commitment).  All FC-BGP enabled ASes that the BGP UPDATE message
   traverses will add the corresponding FC.  It adds the FC according to
   the AS order in AS_PATH and comprises the FC list.  Subsequent ASes
   can then use the FC list in the UPDATE message to verify that the
   advertised path is consistent with the AS_PATH attribute.

   Similar to BGPsec defined in [RFC8205], FC-BGP relies on RPKI to
   perform route origin validation.  Additionally, any FC-enabled BGP
   speaker that wishes to generate and propagate FC along with BGP
   UPDATE messages MUST use a router certificate from RPKI that is
   associated with its AS number.  The router key generation here
   follows [RFC8635].

   It is worth noting that FC-BGP also includes the ability to verify
   data plane forwarding paths.  However, the description of these
   mechanisms is outside the scope of this document.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  FC Attribute

   Unlike BGPsec, FC-BGP doesn't modify the AS_PATH.  FC exists in BGP
   UPDATE messages as an optional, transitive, and extended length path
   attribute, so it is unnecessary to negotiate this feature in the BGP
   OPEN message.

   Though FC-BGP would not modify the AS_PATH path attribute, it is
   REQUIRED never use the AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET in FC-BGP according to
   [RFC6472] says.

   The format of the FC path attribute is shown in Figure 1.

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

                   Figure 1: Format of FC path attribute.

   FC path attribute includes the following parts:

   Flags (1 octet):  The current value is 0b11010000, representing the
      FC attribute as optional, transitive, partial, and extended-
      length.

   Type (1 octet):  The current value is TBD, which is waiting for the
      IANA assignment.  Refer to Section 5.

   FCList Length (2 octets):  The value is the total length of the
      FCList in bytes.

   FCList (variable length):  The value is a sequence of FCs, in order.
      The definition of the FC signed code format is shown in Figure 2.

                          Figure 2: Format of FC.

   In FC-BGP, all ASes MUST use 4-byte AS numbers.  Current assigned
   2-byte AS numbers are converted into 4-byte AS numbers by setting the
   two high-order octets of the 4-octet field to 0 [RFC6793].

   FC signed code includes the following parts.

   Previous Autonomous System Number (PASN, 4 octets):  The AS number of
      the previous AS.  If the current AS has no previous AS hop, it
      MUST be filled with 0.

   Current Autonomous System Number (CASN, 4 octets):  The AS number of
      the current AS.

   Nexthop Autonomous System Number (NASN, 4 octets):  The AS number of
      the next hop AS to whom the current AS will send the BGP UPDATE
      message.

   Subject Key Identifier (SKI, 20 octets):  It exists in the RPKI
      router certificate, used to uniquely identify the public key for
      signature verification.

   Algorithm ID (1 octet):  The current assigned value is 1, indicating
      that SHA256 is used to hash the content to be signed, and ECDSA is
      used for signing.  It follows the algorithm suite defined in
      [RFC8208] and its updates.  As each FC has its Algorithm ID, so no
      need to worry about that one suddenly changing its algorithm
      suite.

   Flags (1 octet):  Its value MUST be 0.  None of these bits are
      assigned values.

   Signature Length (2 octets):  It indicates the signature length in
      bytes.

   Signature (variable length):  The signature content and order are
      Signature=ECDSA(SHA256(PASN, CASN, NASN, Prefix)), where the
      Prefix is the IP address prefix which is encapsulated in the BGP
      UPDATE, and only one prefix is used each time.  For hashing and
      signing, it uses the full IP address and IP prefix length.  The
      full IP address uses 4 bytes for IPv4 and 16 bytes for IPv6.

3.  Processing a Received FC-BGP UPDATE Message

   Upon receiving a BGP UPDATE message carrying FC path attributes, an
   AS will perform the following three steps:

   1.  Verify the AS-Path attribute.

   2.  BGP best path selection.

   3.  Update the FC path attributes and continue advertising the BGP
       route.

   Note that an AS that originates a BGP UPDATE message carrying FC path
   attributes will only perform the third step.  An AS that no longer
   propagates a BGP UPDATE will only complete the first two steps.  For
   the sake of discussion, we assume that AS 65537 receives an FC-BGP
   UPDATE message that contains a declaration for the prefix 192.0.0/24,
   with an originating AS of 65536 and a next hop of 65538.  All three
   ASes support FC-BGP.

3.1.  Verify AS-Path Attribute

   An FC-BGP speaker in AS 65537, upon receiving an UPDATE message,
   retrieves the FC path attribute and extracts the FC list.  It then
   finds the FC with CASN = 65536 and checks if NASN is equal to 65537.
   If so, it uses the SKI field to find the public key and calculates
   the signature using the algorithm specified in the Algorithm ID.  If
   the calculated signature matches the signature in the message, then
   the AS-Path hop of AS 65536 is verified.  This process is repeated
   for all FCs and AS-Paths in the FC list.  If AS 65537 does not
   support FC-BGP, it simply forwards the BGP UPDATE.

3.2.  BGP Best Path Selection

   Based on the AS-Path verification, it is recommended that AS 65537
   prioritize route selection as follows:

   1.  Local preference.  Local preference is the highest priority,
       regardless of the verification results.

   2.  Full path validation.  All AS hops in the AS-Path attribute from
       the source AS to the current AS have successfully passed FC
       validation.

   3.  Partial path validation.  There is a contiguous AS subsequence in
       the AS-Path attribute starting from the source AS.  All AS hops
       in the subsequence have successfully passed FC validation.
       However, there is at least one AS between the last AS in the
       subsequence and the current AS that is missing or fails the FC
       validation.  We denote the number of ASes included in the
       subsequence as N, and the total number of ASes from the source AS
       to the current AS as M.  At this time, N and M need to meet the
       following requirements: if N = 1, then M <= 4; if N > 1, then M
       <= N + 3.  Under these conditions, the route path can still be
       guaranteed to be safe from hijacking.  For detailed analysis, see
       xxx.

   4.  Shorter AS-Path.  The current AS selects the route with the
       shorter AS_PATH.

   5.  Other attributes with lower priority than the AS-Path of the
       shooter.  The addition of FC does not affect the order of route
       selection in this section, so it will not be discussed further.

3.3.  Update the FC path attributes and continue to advertise the BGP
      route

   In FC-BGP, FC protects the route prefix and part of the AS-Path
   information in the UPDATE message.  Since FC contains path
   information, the UPDATE messages received by different BGP peers are
   different.  FC-BGP speakers need to generate different UPDATE
   messages for different peers.  Each UPDATE announcement contains only
   one route prefix and cannot be aggregated.  This is because different
   route prefixes may have different announcement paths due to different
   routing policies.  Multiple aggregated route prefixes will cause FC
   generation and verification errors.  When multiple route prefixes
   need to be announced, the FC-BGP speaker needs to generate different
   UPDATE messages for each route prefix.

   When the AS-PATH uses AS_SEQUENCE in the BGP UPDATE, the FC-BGP
   function will not be enabled.  In other cases, the FC-BGP speaker
   router will enable the FC-BGP function and update the FC path
   attribute after completing the above two steps, and continue to
   announce to other neighbors.

   All FC-BGP UPDATE messages must comply with the maximum BGP message
   size.  If the final message exceeds the maximum message size, then it
   must follow the processing of Section 9.2 of [RFC4271].

   The FC-BGP speaker in AS 65537 will encapsulate each prefix to be
   sent to AS 65538 in a single UPDATE message, add the FC path
   attribute, and sign the path content using its private key.
   Afterwards, AS65537 will insert its own FC at the top of the FC List.
   The FC path attribute uses the message format shown in Figure 1 and
   Figure 2 for filling and packaging.  FC signature uses RPKI router
   certificate.  When signing, first perform SHA256 hash in the order of
   (PASN, CASN, NASN, IP Prefix Address, and IP Prefix Length).  When
   PASN is not present, the field is 0. 0 is reserved by IANA.  For
   specific uses, please refer to [RFC7607].  Calculate the digest
   information Digest, sign the Digest with ECDSA, fill the result into
   the Signature field of the FC message, and fill in the FC fields at
   the same time.  After the FC-BGP speaker is filled, it sends the BGP
   UPDATE message according to the standard BGP processing flow.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8205] and [RFC4272] also apply to
   FC-BGP.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD: Wait for IANA to assign FC-BGP-UPDATE-PATH-ATTRIBUTE-TYPE.
